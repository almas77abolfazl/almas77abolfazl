 **Hi**! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> <br>

With over 3 years of experience in **front-end** web development, I have specialized expertise in building Single Page Applications (SPA) using MVC architectures, particularly with **Angular**.<br>
Along my professional journey, I've also had the opportunity to familiarize myself with frameworks like **NestJS** and **ElectronJS**, steering me towards backend development and working with **Node.js**.<br>
In addition, at my new workplace, I'm delving into **C#** and **.NET** development.
